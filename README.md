# 🎧 MoodSwings

A small personal project that connects moods to music.  
Type what you feel — it grabs matching tracks from Spotify using AI.

## 🧠 What it does

- Uses **Gemini AI** to convert moods (like *“feeling cozy but sad”*) into real Spotify genres.  
- Logs in with your **Spotify account**.  
- Fetches tracks, removes duplicates, and shows covers + previews.  
- Keeps tokens alive automatically with a refresh system.
